    p In this project the goal was to create a portfolio site to showcase some of the previous projects that have been built during the Techdegree. The site contains a modern landing page, an "About" page with the possibility for sharing contact info, and a brief description about myself. There is also a series of project pages to show off and detail the previous projects.

      each project in projects

          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text
