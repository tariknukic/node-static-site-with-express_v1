          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p I have graduated from the faculty of electrical engineering and information technology at the Technical University of Munich. After my studies I started to learn web development with the goal to get my first job in a big tech company. Through different techdegree projects offered by Treehouse, I have gained knowledge in various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, npm, Express and SQL. I have developed my logical thinking as a developer and the ability to solve tasks and problems on my own. I am always interested in taking new challenges as well as gaining more knowledge and experience, especially in the field of web development.
